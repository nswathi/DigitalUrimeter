The problem definition states that, currently nurses are manually noting down the quantity of urine along with other 
information on an hourly basis. This is a true process orchestration issue. Data is being manually and repeatedly re-entered 
in a generation where technology is so advanced to avoid this. The team identified the real need of a solution and being 
passionate on process orchestration decided to adopt this as the final project. The team is looking forward to approach 
the issue from a different angle, i.e., by weight.

Baseline Goal:
Calibrate load cell to achieve high accuracy(About 1g): Temperature compensation technique with overnight testing in different temperature conditions,
Physical data acquisition, regression testing with mock patient setup,
Display of basic patient information on the setup using small LCD display,
Export data into a local database and backup .txt file
3D CAD models of proposed design,
Dynamic patient info change(HTML+photon)

Reach Goal:
Drift compensation for wider range of temperatures,
Web application that mocks the patient monitoring system,
Mock patient to Urimeter setup,
3D printed model of enclosure for the electronics,
Ensure data is sent only when the system is stable,
RFID based login system for nurses,
Responsive system: Visual feedback on connectivity to WIFI,
Battery backup
